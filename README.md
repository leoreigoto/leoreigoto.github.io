# Welcome to my github
I started this page on October 2023. At first I will buy some older codes, they are mostly simple tasks. Unfortunatelly most of my codes where for commercial use and I cant post them here, thought for a few of them I got permission to publish some description / screens, thats why some of doesn't have the code included.
I plan on doing some side projects to publish here, feel free to check my github from time to time to look for updates.

I'm a machine learning researcher with a deep passion for machine learning and computer vision. Contributed
to a university AI research group for three years and authored an article on Zika Virus detection in
mosquitoes. I hold a bachelor's in Control and Automation Engineering and am pursuing a master's in
Computer Science at Universidade Federal Fluminense. My career began in a machine learning startup;
now, I spearhead AI-driven solutions and lead digital transformation. Beyond AI, my technical expertise
extends to IoT, robotics, and automation. Iâ€™m consistently motivated by a relentless desire to innovate.
