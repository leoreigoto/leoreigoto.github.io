# Welcome to my github
I established this page in October 2023. Initially, I'll be uploading some of my older codes, which are primarily straightforward tasks. Unfortunately, many of my projects were developed for commercial purposes, and I can't share the actual code here. However, for a select few, I've received permission to share descriptions and screenshots. So, please note that not all projects will have the accompanying code.

I also plan to embark on some side projects and publish them here. I encourage you to check back occasionally for updates!

I'm a machine learning researcher with a deep passion for machine learning and computer vision. Contributed
to a university AI research group for three years and authored an article on Zika Virus detection in
mosquitoes. I hold a bachelor's in Control and Automation Engineering and am pursuing a master's in
Computer Science at Universidade Federal Fluminense. My career began in a machine learning startup;
now, I spearhead AI-driven solutions and lead digital transformation. Beyond AI, my technical expertise
extends to IoT, robotics, and automation. I’m consistently motivated by a relentless desire to innovate.

## Some projects

****************************************************************************************************************************************
### Using a neural network as a descriptor for keypoint extraction ( Comparing NN vs Shift)
Objective: Testing to keypoint matching using shift descriptor vs neural network descriptor

Python, Computer Vision, Machine Learning

Repository: TO_DO

### Control of a 6-DOF Robotic Arm 
Objective:
To integrate a SolidWorks model of a real-world robotic arm into a simulation environment. This project will derive and implement algorithms for the Kinematics, Inverse Kinematics, Dynamics, and Inverse Dynamics of the robotic arm, enabling accurate position and motion control.

Technologies:
Matlab, Simulink, Robotics, Control and automation Engineering, PID Controller

Repository: https://github.com/leoreigoto/robotic_arm_6_DoF
Inside the repository there are 2 version. One of them have the full project and the other one only contains the Forward Kinematics and trajectory planning (simpler approach).
I advice to simulate new tasks with the Forward Kinematics and trajectory planning before using the full version. It easier to debug this way.

### Image processing to enhance product serial number visibility 
Objective: Improve the clarity of product serial numbers to boost Optical Character Recognition (OCR) accuracy and reliability.

Technologies:
Python, Computer Vision, OpenCV

The product serial numbers are inscribed in green letters on a transparent liquid. To heighten the contrast, a red light — complementary to green — was employed. Various image processing techniques were then applied to further amplify the visibility of the letters under the red light, ensuring effective OCR readings.
