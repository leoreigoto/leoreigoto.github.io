# Welcome to my github
I established this page in October 2023. Initially, I'll be uploading some of my older codes, which are primarily straightforward tasks. Unfortunately, many of my projects were developed for commercial purposes, and I can't share the actual code here. However, for a select few, I've received permission to share descriptions and screenshots. So, please note that not all projects will have the accompanying code.

I also plan to embark on some side projects and publish them here. I encourage you to check back occasionally for updates!

I'm a machine learning researcher with a deep passion for machine learning and computer vision. Contributed
to a university AI research group for three years and authored an article on Zika Virus detection in
mosquitoes. I hold a bachelor's in Control and Automation Engineering and am pursuing a master's in
Computer Science at Universidade Federal Fluminense. My career began in a machine learning startup;
now, I spearhead AI-driven solutions and lead digital transformation. Beyond AI, my technical expertise
extends to IoT, robotics, and automation. Iâ€™m consistently motivated by a relentless desire to innovate.

### Image processing to enhance product serial number visibility 
Objective: Enhance product serial number to enable OCR reading.

Python, Computer Vision

The product consists of green letters on a transparent liquid. I used a red light (complementary color of green) to enhance letter contrast.
I used image processing techniques to further enhance the letter visibility of the product under red light.
