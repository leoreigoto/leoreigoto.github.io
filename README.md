## Welcome to my github
I started this page on October 2023. At first I will buy some older codes, they are mostly simple tasks. Unfortunatelly most of my codes where for commercial use and I cant post them here, thought for a few of them I got permission to publish some description / screens, thats why some of doesn't have the code included.
I plan on doing some side projects to publish here, feel free to check my github from time to time to look for updates.
